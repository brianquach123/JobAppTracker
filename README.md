Hi! This is a small Rust application I built to track job applications.

Users can enter a role name, company, and location. The application will
report all known job applications submitted by the user through a stacked 
bar chart color-coordinated to the status of a job application. Additionally,
the application will report all known job applications submitted by the user
in a section below the stacked bar chart.

To run this application locally: `cargo run -p jobtracker-gui`.
